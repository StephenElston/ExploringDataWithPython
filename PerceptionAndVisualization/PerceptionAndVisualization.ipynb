    "# Perception in Visualization with Python\n",
    "## Stephen Elston\n",
    "## Presented at PyData Seattle, November 4, 2019  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will investigate techniques to maximize the information viewers perceive from data visualizations. Creating visualization with techniques that account for human perception can highlight important insights. When faced with trying to understand complex datasets the limits of human perception become a significant factor. To better explore such complex data you can apply the results of the considerable research available on human perceptions for data visualization.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use several Python packages to create the  visualizations, ```matplotlib```, ```Pandas``` plotting, and ```seaborn```. The code examples in this notebook use each of these packages. \n",

    "For these lessons we will be working with a data set containing the prices and characteristics of a number of automobiles. The ultimate goal is to understand the relationship between the price of a car and its characteristics. "

    "\n",
    "These lessons are divided into three parts. In each part we will explore one aspect of using Python visualization tools to effectively understand the relationships in complex datasets. Primarily, we will work with plot aesthetics used to highlight relationships for complex datasets. By plot aesthetics we mean properties of a visualization which highlight aspects of the data relationships.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Easy to perceive plot aesthetics:** We will start by applying some aesthetics which generally are easy for people to perceive.   \n",
    "  - Marker position,\n",
    "  - Bar length,\n",
    "  - Aspect ratio,\n",
    "  - Sequential and divergent color palettes,   \n",
    "  - Maker size.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Aesthetics with limited perceptive power:** We will review some commonly used aesthetics which are often used, but which may not be the best choices for human perception.   \n",
    "  - Qualitative color palettes,\n",
    "  - Line type,\n",
    "  - Marker shape.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **Plotting for multiple views:** Understanding complex datasets can require multiple views, sometimes even for the same relationship. These views can be as simple as a comparison plots or as plots which slice data.    \n",
    "  - Comparing side by side plots of subsets of a complex data,\n",
    "  - Pairwise scatter plots for visualization of pairwise combinations of the variables, \n",
    "  - Faceted, conditioned or small multiple plots are all names for a method which produces visual slices through complex data.   \n"

    "\n",
    "As a general rule, you should never start creating analytical or machine learning models until you have examined the data and understand the relationships. Otherwise, you risk wasting your time creating models blindly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization is also a powerful tool for presentation of results and for determining sources of problems with analytics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts of exploring and analyzing a data set visually was pioneered by John Tukey in the 1960s and 1970s. Tukey consolidated his many ideas on data exploration into a book in the late 1970s, *John Tukey, Exploratory Data Analysis, 1977, Addison-Westley*.\n",

    "Edward Tufte is well know for his different take on data exploration and visualizaion. His first book outlined many of his key ideas: *Edward Tufte, Envisioning Information, Graphics Press, 1990*. His more famous book first appeared in 1993, and is still widely available: *Edward Tufte, Envisioning Information, 2nd Edition, Graphics Press, 2001*.\n",
